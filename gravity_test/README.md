# Gravity Test
A simple example showing gravity.

## Building
This requires GCC and Make to build, and uses SDL2 as a library.

GCC and Make should already be install on Linux and OSX.

SDL2 can be installed from [The SDL site](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).
Instructions are included, basically copy the SDL2.framework file to /Library/Frameworks

To build, run `make osx` on the command line.
To run, run `./jumpy`.
